# Dissertation

This repository contains the LaTeX code for my dissertation that is auto compiled on each push to master in Gitlab CI, the up to date final output PDF is [available here](https://visualising-sensitivity-classification-features.gitlab.io/dissertation/l4proj.pdf).

Development (issues, boards, CI, Docker respositories...) happens on [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/visualising-sensitivity-classification-features/dissertation) and a mirror (source code only, no issues etc...) of this repository is available on [github.com](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/dissertation-dissertation).

## LaTeX
This template has been tested with `latexmk`. It should also work with `xelatex` and `lualatex`. Note that on Linux you may need to copy the contents of the `fonts/` folder to `~/.fonts/`.
